                >
                is a popular programming language that has been remarkably easy
                to learn, and also it works as a stepping stone for
                understanding other programming languages and frameworks. Even
                if you are an absolute beginner and have no idea of coding and
                programming, then it is the perfect option for you to try and
                consider once.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is widely used by big giant companies such as Google,
                Pinterest, Instagram, Disney, Yahoo!, Nokia, IBM, and many more.
                And even if coding and other technical things won’t matter you,
                then here’s a piece of good news, if once you learn Python, then
                you get abundant ways to utilize the skill. And the best part is
                that a lot of big giant IT and other companies depend entirely
                on this language which lets you make good money as a Python
                developer.

              <h1>Reasons to Learn Python:</h1>
              <p style="color: #ffb400; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold">
                1. It is a big community:
              </p>
              <p>
                No doubt, Python has a large community which helps you in
                learning new technology and being with the experienced
                professional is also one of the most significant assets. And
                when it comes to learning a programming language, you can get
                stuck with one or the other issue, and that’s when you’ll need a
                helping hand. So, as we know Google has most of the answers, the
                solution can be found in minutes, but there are several other
                communities such as StackOverflow and many others which is a
                common platform for various Python experts to help beginners and
                experienced people with their issues.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #ffb400; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold">
                2. Machine Learning:
              </p>
              <p>
                As we all know, the machine learning trend is gaining pace
                rapidly, and it is also one of the main reasons why programmers
                are learning Python in 2019. The complexity of algorithms is
                getting sophisticated day by day, which leads us to Python as it
                is the only primary programming language that makes things easy
                for you to understand and do a pet project or want to learn new
                concepts. And not just machine learning, but it is also
                recommended as the best platform for Data Science as here, you
                will find more relevant libraries, content as a developer
                community.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #ffb400; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold">
                3. Web Development:
              </p>
              <p>
                All the development platforms, Data Science and, even machine
                learning prefer the Python programming language. The main reason
                is that it offers so many relevant libraries and frameworks such
                as Django and Flask, which have consequently made web
                development an effortless task to perform. Thus, the task which
                takes hours in PHP can be easily accomplished within a few
                minutes on Python, and it is also used a lot for web scraping.
                The Python web development frameworks such as Django and Flask
                are the most recommended frameworks for creating web
                applications in no time.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #ffb400; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold">
                4. Simplicity:
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a straightforward programming language to learn even for
                non-coders. As it does not contain the language which has tough
                syntaxes or weird rules to follow. It is both readable and
                straightforward with an easy setup to deal with. So, install
                Python, and you are done with no issues ahead, unlike other
                programming languages. Also, while installing it, whenever
                asked, you have to add Python in the desired path which helps
                you to run it from anywhere on your computer.
              </p>
              <p style="color: #ffb400; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold">
                5. It helps in performing multipurpose tasks:
              </p>
              <p>
                It allows the developers to perform multiple tasks at the same
                time and is not stuck to just one thing. Such as R, a
                programming language is functional on Data Science and Machine
                learning, but eventually, it has made its place in web
                development as well. It helps you to diversify your knowledge
                and talent with different frameworks and do many things
                simultaneously.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, create your desired web applications using Django and Flask,
                can perform Data Analysis and also write the scripts to automate
                and control your day to day tasks.
