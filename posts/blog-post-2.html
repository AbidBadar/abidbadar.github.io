              <p>
                You start a website to generate online business, but you are not
                getting the desired result. Everything seems fine on the
                website, the content, designs, graphics, and marketing is all
                top-notch. The SEO team has also done a fabulous job on the
                website; still, you are not getting business. Do you know why?
              </p>
              <p>
                One fine day you are causally scrolling the website and
                comparing it with others, then you find the actual cause; it’s
                the speed or the loading time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your website loads with a delay of 3 to 5 seconds compared to
                others; that is why you are getting visitors but not the
                business. All your months’ preparation and marketing strategy go
                in vain because of a few seconds of delay.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you are wondering about how the loading time can affect your
                business despite having a great product and service. Is speed
                that important? Let’s find out.
              </p>
              <h1 class="text-uppercase text-capitalize">
                Importance of Website Speed
              </h1>
              <p>
                When we do business online, we have less time to impress and
                persuade the visitors. If we are not quick, then we might lose a
                potential long-term loyal customer or client. Studies found that
                if a website takes more than 4 seconds, the user will leave the
                website and look for another one for the same service.
              </p>
              <p>

                </a>
                update, website loading time has also become an essential part
                of the ranking. Page speed defines user experience, and a 7%
                decrease in conversion is reported with just a 1-second delay in
                the page loading time.

                A quick responsive website can give your following benefits:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To improve your first impression.</li>
                <li>Increased response time, hence more conversion.</li>
                <li>Improved Google ranking.</li>
                <li>Get more ads, hence more revenue from google’s side.</li>

              <p>
                It is the best website speed test tool you can find on the
                internet. It gives you detailed information about your website’s
                performance. You will get a piece of brief information about
                page speed, timings, performance score, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from various connections and browser types, there is an
                advanced feature of video playback with which you can see the
                actual cause of the website bottleneck.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially, GTmetrix used YSlow and PageSpeed metrics, but in
                2020, it was replaced with Google’s Lighthouse tool, which is
                considered the top-tier standard of web performance improvement.
                To use this feature, you need to create a google account, but
                most of the features are free.

                Another famous website speed test tool is Pingdom. It has been
                an established expert service provider for years. It is not like
                other tools that require an account or membership to operate.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Pingdom’s report can provide you with information about various
                aspects of your website. The report is majorly divided into four
                sections which are waterfall breakdown, performance grade, page
                analysis, and history so that you can make necessary
                improvisations in the website.

              <p>
                Uptrends is an excellent website performance test tool that
                offers to test the website’s performance on desktop as well as
                mobile devices. There is a choice of a few locations to analyze
                region-wise performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also choose the screen’s resolution on all four primary
                browsers, i.e., Chrome, PhantomJS, Firefox, and IE.
              </p>
              <p>
                One primary reason for Uptrends popularity is its UI design. It
                is the best-looking website tool out there.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are plenty of options available with the free version, but
                you have to spend a few hundred dollars to get advanced
                features. The bandwidth throttling test is also an option to
                test sites under different scenarios.

                The easy yet comprehensive web page speed checker tool was
                developed by the extensively famous and most prominent search
                engine company Google.
              </p>
              <p>
                This tool evaluates your website on a scale of 1 to 100 on both
                mobile and desktop, and you know higher is better. The UI and
                functionality are user-friendly, and all you need to do is paste
                your website’s link in the URL section, and you are all set.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information is comprehensive, and you will get the data in
                no time. If you get a score of 90or more than this, your website
                will be considered highly optimized, but you need improvements
                if you get a score less than that. The only fault of this tool
                is the deficiency of features.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike any other tool, the Google Page Speed test will provide
                only basic information about the website, and options like
                location test, request customization, and alerts options are not
                here.

                This page speed checker tool will not wow you with the design,
                but it is the most reliable and trustworthy performance tool out
                there. It is an open-source tool that enables you to run tests
                on 40+ locations and 25+ browsers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The option to test the websites on various network strengths is
                also there, i.e., you can check it on a slow and fast internet
                connection.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is more of an advanced tool if you compare it with other
                tools in the list. By default, it runs three tests consistently
                and displays the result of all three tests. You can check the
                errors and improvise the website accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                You also get the liberty to analyze each result by simply
                expanding it deeply. The result is shown in the gradings, and
                the website will be ranked from F to A depending on various
                aspects like compression, FTTB, caching, etc.
